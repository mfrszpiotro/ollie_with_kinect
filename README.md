Desktop application that can record and compare two performances of the ollie maneuver. With my work I have introduced convenient, modern and sliglthly different than obsolete Microsoft environment for creating applications using the Kinect device.

The desktop application was developed using TypeScript programming language with Electron and React frameworks. It utilizes Microsoft Kinect v2 drivers to collect data from the depth sensor, and can display recording previews and comparison results thanks to popular web development technology stack including HTML, CSS, and React. This application can serve as a learning tool for skateboarders.

[This project was delivered alongside my bachelor thesis paper done at Warsaw University of Technology, Institute of Radioelectronics and Multimedia Technology.](/docs/praca_inzynierska_mpiotrowski.pdf)
